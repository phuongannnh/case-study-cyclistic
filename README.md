# Case Study: How Cyclistic Navigates Speedy Success
*Note: This case study is a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Program on Coursera.*  
  
## Introduction
Welcome to my analysis of Cyclistic's bike-share program! In this case study, I worked for a fictional company, Cyclistic, alongside some key team members. To answer the business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. The Case Study Roadmap tables—including guiding questions and key tasks—helped me stay on the right path.  
  
## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.  
  
## Characters and Teams
**Cyclistic:** A bike-share program with over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive for people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. Most riders opt for traditional bikes, with about 8% using the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.  
**Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and my manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.  
**Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team:** A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic's marketing strategy. I joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals, as well as how I, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.  
**Cyclistic Executive Team:** The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.  
  
## About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.  
  
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.  
  
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.  
  
Moreno has set a clear goal: design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. To do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
